# Comparing Python Compression Libraries: zlib, LZ4, Brotli, and Zstandard

In our never-ending quest to optimize data storage and transmission, compression remains a vital tool. Today, I'm delving into a comparison of four popular Python libraries for compressionâ€”zlib, LZ4, Brotli, and Zstandard. My focus is on their compression ratio, compression time, and decompression time using a ~2.5MB JSON file, sample_data.json. Please note that I created this comarition to determine what is the best way to cache compressed data in Redis as a part of my work. Which is why you will find I have used Redis (which may not be something you need to purely test these libraries).

## Methodology

I wrote a Python script that performs the following steps for each library:

* Read and Encode Data: The JSON data is read, converted to a string with json.dumps, and encoded to bytes.
* Initialize Redis: To simulate a practical application, compressed data is written to and read from a local Redis instance.
* Compression and Decompression: I conducted 1000 compression operations, storing each result in Redis. This was followed by 10000 decompression operations, fetching the data from Redis each time.
* Metrics Calculation: The script calculates the compression ratio as well as total times for compression and decompression. These metrics help gauge each library's efficiency.

## Observations

Here's a brief overview of the results obtained from the testing (Tested on my ThinkPad T14, Ubuntu. Python 3.12):

### zlib

    Compression Ratio: 27.84
    Compression Time: 7.41 seconds
    Decompression Time: 12.89 seconds

### LZ4

Compression Ratio: 18.23
Compression Time: 0.17 seconds
Decompression Time: 0.86 seconds

### Brotli

Compression Ratio: 64.78
Compression Time: 206.58 seconds
Decompression Time: 1.43 seconds

### Zstandard

Compression Ratio: 43.42
Compression Time: 0.19 seconds
Decompression Time: 0.76 seconds

## Analysis

Each library offers unique advantages:

* zlib provides a moderate compression ratio but at the cost of higher time for both compression and decompression.
* LZ4 shines in speed, making it ideal for scenarios where time is more critical than the space saved.
* Brotli delivers the highest compression ratio, which could be very beneficial for reducing storage needs or for network transfers where bandwidth is limited. However, it takes significantly longer to compress data.
* Zstandard offers a balanced profile with good compression ratio and better time efficiency than Brotli and zlib.

## Conclusion

The choice of a compression library depends on specific needs: LZ4 for speed, Brotli for maximum compression, and Zstandard as a middle ground. zlib, while widely used, may not always be the best choice depending on the scenario.
